 I spearheaded a project aimed at empowering the Revenue team in hospitality with data-driven insights. It's been exhilarating leveraging data analytics to drive informed decisions in a dynamic industry.

Key Outputs: Through Power BI, I've crafted a dynamic dashboard delivering critical insights in the Hospitality Domain:

    RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): A pivotal metric illuminating revenue generation.
    ADR (Average Daily Rate): Analyzing the average rate paid for rooms sold.
    DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracking daily room bookings.
    DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Monitoring the daily inventory available for sale.
    DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Providing insights into daily room utilization by customers.
